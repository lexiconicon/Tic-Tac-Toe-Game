# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns clicking on cells to place their mark—either "X" or "O." A heading displays whose turn it is and updates with each move. A "Reset" button clears the grid, allowing players to start a new game. When a player wins or the board fills resulting in a draw, an alert displays the outcome.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Play**: The game alternates turns between "X" and "O" players.
- **Dynamic Status Update**: A heading indicates the current player's turn.
- **Win Detection**: Alerts the players when one has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Detection**: Displays an alert if the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Button**: Clears the board to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game board
- **Bootstrap**: Styling and layout responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, turn handling, win/draw detection

## How to Play

1. Click on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark (X or O).
2. Alternate turns until a player wins by aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal—or until the board is full.
3. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game at any time.

## Future Improvements

- Add scoring to track wins, losses, and draws.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Enhance the UI with animations for moves and winning lines.
